# Realtime Image Sync
This project allows users to upload pictures and specify some configuration. It then displays the pictures to any device that visits the generated url, and changes the pictures in realtime. All the pictures across all devices connected to the same url will be synced (With some delay due to network latency).

# Deployment
This project will be deployed on Heroku. Proper security measures are not put into place, although there is a password, any guy with half-decent hacking tools can likely gain access to your photos. So please do not upload any **sensitive or private** data.
